## fibonacci O(1) 😎 (python)
This fibonacci depends on a formula that doesn't use sigma and has O(1)

The formula

## memoization 🧠 (python)
This concept makes the recursive computation much faster as from its name it memorizes old answers

## recursive sin cos  (python)
Here I used recursion to make sin and cos 
The science behind it is that when the angle is from 0 to 10 degrees the sin is nearly equal to the radian angle 

> note that you can do it with more precision using maclaurin


## simulating while loop 🤖 (c)
This code simulates the while loop concept but using goto control flow
